# Bouncing Balls Animation

An interactive HTML5 Canvas animation featuring balls with different physical properties.

## Features

- Multiple ball types with unique behaviors:
  - Floppy balls (Purple): Very squishy with high friction
  - Bouncy balls (Green): High restitution and low friction
  - Light balls (Blue): Half gravity and very low friction
  - Normal balls (Red): Standard physics properties

- Physics simulation includes:
  - Gravity (variable by ball type)
  - Friction
  - Elastic collisions
  - Squish effects on impact
  - Mass-based collision responses

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `bouncing_balls.html` in a web browser
3. Watch the balls bounce and interact!

## Technical Details

- Built with vanilla JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas
- No external dependencies
- Implements realistic physics calculations
- Visual feedback through colors and squish animations
